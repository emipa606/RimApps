Earn ressources with RimApps !

Make followers by creating and posting content on different platforms : RimTube, RimTwich, RimTify, RimBook and RimHub.
Use those followers to build Ad Servers that will grand you ressources regularly.

There are five different servers to build, each one giving you different ressources every 15 days.

RimTube : plasteel
RimTwich : uranium
RimTify : steel
RimBook : silver
RimHub : gold

Each Ad Server comes in three different versions : Basic, Intermediate, Advanced.
Higher version means more ressources received.

Followers can also be bought (like irl, yeah i know reality sucks) from the Followers Trader.

Enjoy.
Stokovski
