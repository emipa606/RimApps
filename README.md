# **Farm ressources with RimApps !**


Make **Followers** by creating and posting content on different platforms : **RimTube, RimTwich, RimTify, RimBook and RimHub.** Use those followers to build **Ad Servers** that will grant you ressources regularly.

There are five different servers to build, each one giving you different ressources.

## **RimTube Ads**

Gives you **plasteel** every 15 days.
## **RimTwich Ads**

Gives you **uranium** every 15 days.
## **RimTify Ads**

Gives you **steel** every 15 days.
## **RimBook Ads**

Gives you **silver** every 15 days.
## **RimHub Ads**

Gives you **gold** every 15 days.


Each **Ad Server** comes in three different versions : 
**Basic, Intermediate, Advanced.**

Higher techs are available through researches. Higher servers version means more ressources received.

Followers can also be bought (like irl, yeah i know reality sucks) from the **Followers Trader.**


Hope you enjoy it.
Now go make money !
